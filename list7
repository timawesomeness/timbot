Tell me what the problem is.

Tom didn't press the issue. 
I guess that you can't do it. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
I think I can handle it. 
We can make a day of it. 
Put it back where you found it. 
Anyway, I don't like it. 
Let me have a look at it. 
It's up to you to do it. 
I'm not going to sell it. 
Please have someone else do it. 
Can I take your word for it? 
I paid 10 dollars for it. 
How do you feel about it? 
Lovely sunset, isn't it? 
I know nothing about it. 
I'll have to think about it. 
I can't afford to buy it. 
Even a child can do it. 
Let me have a try at it. 
I feel guilty about it. 
I completely forget it. 
I don't know if he knows it. 
Anybody can read it. 
The whole town knows about it. 
Christmas is soon, isn't it? 
This place is large, isn't it? 
It's OK not to eat it. 
I have to think about it. 
I don't know how to say it. 
She ordered him to do it. 
That skirt's too short, isn't it? 
Tom denies having done it. 
Tom denied having done it. 
Nobody saw Tom do it. 
Tom forced Mary to do it. 
I spent 10 dollars on it. 
Why do I have to do it? 
Tom shut the door and locked it. 
Tom closed the door and locked it. 
I can't really describe it. 
It's been a while, hasn't it? 
We must tell him about it. 
Tom won't get away with it. 
Tom has already seen it. 
I have no doubt about it. 
If I have time, I'll do it. 
I wouldn't have dreamed of it. 
I should have stayed out of it. 
I don't like the look of it. 
Tom can't get enough of it. 
I hope we'll find lots of it. 
Tom vowed he'd never do it. 
My father won't allow it. 
I'm not going to touch it. 
I'll show you how to do it. 
I'm not sure if he saw it. 
Why are you not doing it? 
Don't even think about it. 
Tom showed me how to do it. 
I wasn't ready for it. 
Do you think Tom will do it? 
I'd like to think about it. 
I'd like to see you try it. 
I can't even look at it. 
I can't identify it. 
I thought it'd be worth it. 
Don't ask questions, just do it. 
I still feel bad about it. 
I see nothing wrong with it. 
Let's just make the best of it. 
Let's at least talk about it. 
Let's just forget about it. 
Let's not worry about it. 
I didn't want to do it. 
Tom wanted us to see it. 
Tom didn't want to do it. 
I didn't want to waste it. 
I don't want to forget it. 
I'd like to talk about it. 
I don't want talk about it. 
I don't want to discuss it. 
I told you I don't want it. 
I'd like to learn about it. 
Why do you want to sell it? 
I still don't want to do it. 
Tom doesn't want to hear it. 
Don't you want me to keep it? 
Tom wants to know who did it. 
I'd like to help Tom prove it. 
They don't want you to use it. 
Are you sure you don't want it? 
I want you to sleep on it. 
I'd like you to handle it. 
I want you to handle it. 
I'll be happy to do it. 
You sound happy about it. 
I'll trade you something for it. 
Please show me how to do it. 
No one would talk about it. 
Why don't you and Tom do it? 
Why don't you just forget it? 
We're investigating it. 
Everybody believes it. 
I don't feel like doing it. 
Don't bother denying it. 
Tom is overdoing it. 
Don't bother to deny it. 
Don't even joke about it. 
Don't you worry about it. 
I didn't even see it. 
I just don't understand it. 
I really don't believe it. 
Maybe Tom didn't touch it. 
Tom didn't know about it. 
Why didn't you mention it? 
Why didn't you report it? 
You probably won't like it. 
Don't ask me to explain it. 
Don't think about it. Do it. 
Don't worry. I can fix it. 
I bet you didn't drink it. 
I didn't have to move it. 
I didn't hear you say it. 
I didn't know you kept it. 
I didn't mean to do it. 
I didn't mean to take it. 
I didn't say I liked it. 
I didn't think we'd need it. 
I already believe it. 
I already regret it. 
I asked Tom why he did it. 
I asked Tom to describe it. 
I can take it or leave it. 
I can win. I'm sure of it. 
I felt guilty about it. 
I certainly will miss it. 
This CD is mine, isn't it? 
I don't know how they do it. 
I don't know how to do it. 
I don't know how you did it. 
I don't see your name on it. 
I don't think you should do it. 
I forgot all about it. 
I guess I just don't get it. 
I guess that's how I'd do it. 
I've already arranged it. 
I've already ordered it. 
I've already seen to it. 
I've always been good at it. 
I've always kind of liked it. 
I've got Tom working on it. 
I've thought a lot about it. 
I don't feel good about it. 
I don't know why Tom did it. 
I don't want to handle it. 
I guess Tom didn't find it. 
I guess Tom didn't like it. 
I know Tom didn't do it. 
I said Tom didn't do it. 
I should have expected it. 
I think Tom didn't do it. 
I think you didn't do it. 
I won't try to describe it. 
I'm sure Tom didn't mean it. 
I don't know how to use it. 
I don't think I can do it. 
I just found out about it. 
I just thought I'd mention it. 
I knew how to deal with it. 
I knew you couldn't do it. 
I knew you were behind it. 
I know how to deal with it. 
I know something about it. 
I know you had to do it. 
I need to think about it. 
I never even saw it. 
I never think about it. 
I never thought about it. 
I no longer believe it. 
I ordered Tom to do it. 
I reckon you should do it. 
I refuse to accept it. 
I refuse to allow it. 
I don't know why you did it. 
I don't know why you need it. 
I refused to believe it. 
Last night was great, wasn't it? 
Oh, didn't I mention it? 
Tom pressured me to do it. 
I said I would handle it. 
I said I'd think about it. 
I said I'll think about it. 
I said I'm tired of it. 
I said we'll take care of it. 
I said we'd take care of it. 
I seriously doubt it. 
I should never have done it. 
I should tell Tom to try it. 
I should've tried to stop it. 
I shouldn't have taken it. 
I think I know who did it. 
I think I understand it. 
I think I'll get over it. 
I think we can handle it. 
I think we have to risk it. 
I think you can handle it. 
I think you really mean it. 
He continued doing it. 
Did you tell Tom about it? 
I'm sure you'll be good at it. 
I'm so glad you could make it. 
I'll have Tom take care of it. 
Tom won't know how to use it. 
That's the problem, isn't it? 
That was the plan, wasn't it? 
I'm still getting used to it. 
I don't think you'd enjoy it. 
That's everything, isn't it? 
I'm sure someone will do it. 
I'm just getting used to it. 
I'm glad you're enjoying it. 
I'll need to think about it. 
I'll let you think about it. 
You won't get away with it. 
That's fantastic, isn't it? 
It's interesting, isn't it? 
I'm telling you Tom did it. 
I'm sure you can handle it. 
I'm really glad to hear it. 
I'll tell you if I find it. 
I told you I can't make it. 
I don't know much about it. 
Tom's not very good at it. 
That was a lie, wasn't it? 
I'm not satisfied with it. 
I'll talk to Tom about it. 
I would advise against it. 
I wish I could explain it. 
Beautiful night, isn't it? 
It's difficult, isn't it? 
I'm sorry I mentioned it. 
I'm pretty sure about it. 
I'm not worried about it. 
I'm not sure I can do it. 
I'm glad I got to see it. 
I would've let Tom do it. 
I wasn't prepared for it. 
This is silly, isn't it? 
That's ironic, isn't it? 
It's pathetic, isn't it? 
I'm not going to eat it. 
I'm getting tired of it. 
I wouldn't recommend it. 
I wasn't planning on it. 
It's obvious, isn't it? 
I'm not going to do it. 
I'd forgotten about it. 
It's ironic, isn't it? 
Irritating, isn't it? 
Incredible, isn't it? 
I'm excited about it. 
Tom tried, but couldn't do it. 
That was your plan, wasn't it? 
This isn't your place, is it? 
This isn't my fault, is it? 
This is your bag, isn't it? 
Tom said he didn't get it. 
It's your money, isn't it? 
Tom said I didn't get it. 
Tom wasn't expecting it. 
Tom decided against it. 
One of us has to do it. 
Somebody had to do it. 
Is there a problem with it? 
It's not a problem, is it? 
How big a problem is it? 
I could scarcely believe it. 
What's wrong with how we did it? 
Your name isn't Tom, is it? 
There's no question about it. 
That's not important, is it? 
It's kind of hot, isn't it? 
Tom wasn't ready for it. 
Tom doesn't have to do it. 
That wasn't so bad, was it? 
Today's Monday, isn't it? 
Are you about to do it? 
Do you think we can do it? 
Do you think you can do it? 
How's Tom going to do it? 
It's not going well, is it? 
See what you can do with it. 
So, what do you think of it? 
Somebody's got to do it. 
That wasn't so hard, was it? 
That would be nice, wouldn't it? 
That's what we want, isn't it? 
This is so weird, isn't it? 
What do you know about it? 
What if Tom doesn't make it? 
Why didn't you go get it? 
I wonder why Tom did it. 
We intend to destroy it. 
Tom asked Mary to do it. 
I asked Tom how he'd do it. 
Nobody wants to do it? 
How come you didn't do it? 
I told you you could do it. 
We're so glad you could make it. 
That's just the way Tom likes it. 
Why do you think they like it? 
What makes you think I'll like it? 
Something's happened to it. 
Now we know how Tom did it. 
Do you know how Tom did it? 
We paid a fair price for it. 
But I'm still not buying it. 
Can you help me look for it? 
That's a fake beard, isn't it? 
Do you know why Tom did it? 
I probably sat on it. 
We've never talked about it. 
Does Tom think Mary did it? 
I think Tom can handle it. 
Come on Tom, think about it. 
I don't think I can fix it. 
Does Tom think he can do it? 
Tom said he'd think about it. 
Tom says he'll think about it. 
Tom says he can pay for it. 
Did I tell you I had it? 
You told me not to do it. 
Tom told me all about it. 
Now tell me all about it. 
Can Tom tell us about it? 
Tell Tom I didn't read it. 
Just tell me how to do it. 
Tell me you didn't take it. 
Can't we tell Tom about it? 
You told me you could do it. 
Tell me where I can find it. 
I could tell you who did it. 
Please tell Tom that I'll do it. 
You're going to ruin it. 
We're going to destroy it. 
We're not going to sell it. 
We're not going to do it.

Can I use your telephone? 
May I use your telephone? 
I don't have a telephone. 
May I use this telephone?

You can watch television. 
Turn down the television. 
I have a story to tell. 
I like the stories you tell. 
Oh, there isn't much to tell.

I have a high temperature. 
Do you have a temperature?

How about playing tennis? 
Tomorrow he'll play tennis. 
She intends to play tennis.

We're going to play tennis. 
I've never seen Tom so tense. 
I'm feeling a little tense. 
You do seem a little tense.

I don't want any more tests. 
Where do we get the textbooks? 
I just wanted to say thanks. 
Tom didn't even say thanks. 
I would never have guessed that. 
He would be glad to hear that. 
I didn't mean to do that. 
Anybody can do that. 
Don't talk back to me like that. 
Stop staring at me like that. 
We got a good price for that. 
I'm very sad to hear that. 
I don't think we should do that. 
Which is cheaper, this or that? 
Which is better, this or that? 
Why on earth did you do that? 
How do you account for that? 
He wondered why she did that. 
Even I can't believe that. 
I hate people who say that. 
I was hoping you'd say that. 
I wonder why he did that. 
What's the point in doing that? 
Tom doesn't do things like that. 
Tom didn't mean to do that. 
Tom can't stand people like that. 
Tom doesn't have to do that. 
Tom didn't have to do that. 
Tom wished he hadn't said that. 
Tom was relieved to hear that. 
Tom told them not to do that. 
Tom ought to stop doing that. 
Tom has no problem with that. 
Tom has no right to say that. 
I think you're wrong about that. 
I suppose I could do that. 
I don't believe I'll do that. 
He's unable to do that. 
There's no way I'm doing that. 
I wish you wouldn't do that. 
I wish you didn't do that. 
I wish you hadn't done that. 
I don't see what's wrong with that. 
Don't think about stuff like that. 
I wish you'd stop doing that. 
Why would you want to do that? 
I bet you didn't know that. 
Don't waste your time doing that. 
Tom and Mary don't know that. 
Do you think I don't know that? 
Do you need a hand with that? 
I don't know why I did that. 
I don't want you to do that. 
I wasn't expecting that. 
I'm pretty sure about that. 
We shouldn't have told Tom that. 
You shouldn't be doing that. 
You can't force Tom to do that. 
A sane man wouldn't do that. 
I'd like to talk about that. 
I thought I'd never hear that. 
I can't ask Tom to do that. 
We can't be certain of that. 
I can't believe I did that. 
I can't believe I said that. 
I can't believe Tom ate that. 
I can't believe Tom said that. 
I can't believe you said that. 
You can't blame yourself for that.

We can't force Tom to do that. 
You can't put a price on that. 
I can't really believe that. 
We can't really discuss that. 
I can't really tell them that. 
I can't recall who said that. 
You can't talk to Tom like that. 
I can't tell you more than that. 
You can't yell at me like that. 
I thought you didn't know that. 
I like it when you do that. 
Let's allow Tom to do that. 
I didn't want to do that. 
I wouldn't want to do that. 
Why do you want to do that? 
I certainly don't want that. 
Tom doesn't want to do that. 
Tom may not want to do that. 
Tom wanted you to know that. 
We wouldn't want to do that. 
Why would I want to do that? 
I don't want Tom to see that. 
Tom and Mary don't want that. 
Why do you want to know that? 
Why would we want to do that? 
You don't want me to do that. 
You wouldn't want to do that. 
Tom would want me to say that. 
What made you want to do that? 
Why would Tom want to do that? 
You may want to tell Tom that. 
I don't want to live with that. 
People don't want to hear that. 
I didn't mean it like that. 
Why would Tom want to change that? 
I don't want you doing that. 
We wouldn't want to risk that. 
You said you didn't want that. 
Was Tom happy doing that? 
Could you be careful with that? 
You should be careful with that. 
I couldn't blame you for that. 
No one would blame you for that. 
Where did you learn to do that? 
Is there something wrong with that? 
Would I do something like that? 
Why don't you go check on that? 
Why don't you help Tom with that? 
Tom doesn't understand that. 
Don't even joke about that. 
Don't you ever forget that. 
Don't you worry about that? 
I didn't think about that. 
I don't normally do that. 
I don't worry about that. 
Most people won't notice that. 
Why didn't you mention that? 
Don't be so sure about that. 
I didn't have to do that. 
I didn't know dogs did that. 
I didn't know Tom did that. 
I didn't have time for that. 
I didn't know you did that. 
I didn't need to see that. 
I didn't say you did that. 
I already told Tom that. 
I already told you that. 
I think I can help with that. 
I can do better than that. 
I can empathize with that. 
I can hardly believe that. 
I can't believe you'd do that. 
I can't believe you did that. 
I could fire you for that. 
I do appreciate that. 
I don't know how to do that. 
I don't recall saying that. 
I don't know much about that. 
I don't know much more than that. 
I don't like the sound of that. 
I don't think I can do that. 
I don't think I should do that. 
I don't think Tom would do that. 
I don't think Tom would like that. 
I don't think you should do that. 
I feel awful about that. 
I figured Tom would say that. 
I forgot all about that. 
I had to stop doing that. 
I hadn't considered that. 
I hadn't thought about that. 
I hate it when they do that. 
I hate it when Tom does that. 
I hate it when you do that. 
I hate it when you say that. 
I have a problem with that. 
I've already explained that. 
I've already told you that. 
I've been concerned about that. 
I've never considered that. 
I've never seen one like that. 
I've never seen Tom like that. 
I have no problem with that. 
I don't believe I did that. 
I don't really sing like that. 
I don't think I ordered that. 
I don't think you believe that. 
I hope Tom didn't see that. 
I'm sure Tom didn't mean that. 
I'm sure Tom doesn't think that. 
I've already checked on that. 
I don't think you can sell that. 
I just can't wait to do that. 
I keep asking myself that. 
I knew you'd ask about that. 
I know you better than that. 
I might not have told Tom that. 
I might take you up on that. 
I need to think about that. 
I never do things like that. 
I never knew about that. 
I never meant to do that. 
I never thought about that. 
I never thought I'd say that. 
I refuse to accept that. 
I refuse to answer that. 
I remember saying that. 
I'm looking forward to that. 
We didn't need to do that. 
You don't have to answer that. 
You don't need to explain that. 
I see no need to do that. 
I see no problem with that. 
I see nothing wrong with that. 
I seriously doubt that. 
I should probably take that. 
I suppose Tom told you that. 
I suppose we could do that. 
I swore I'd never do that. 
I think I can answer that. 
I think I can arrange that. 
I think I can handle that. 
I think Tom understood that. 
I think Tom would have liked that. 
I think we can handle that. 
I think you should tell Tom that. 
I think you'd remember that. 
You've got no right to say that. 
I'm sure you heard all of that. 
I'm sure we could arrange that. 
I'm still getting used to that. 
I'm not surprised to hear that. 
Tom won't know how to do that. 
I'm sure Tom understands that. 
I'm sure Tom meant to do that. 
I'm sure Tom can arrange that. 
I'm not sure how to take that. 
I'm glad to hear you say that. 
I'll teach you how to do that. 
I'll have to think about that. 
I'll have to get used to that. 
I wish you'd stop saying that. 
I wish you'd stop asking that. 
I've already thought of that. 
I'm sure you understand that. 
I'm not willing to risk that. 
I'm afraid you can't do that. 
I'll need a receipt for that. 
I wish you'd quit doing that. 
You've already told me that. 
We have no right to do that. 
I'm sure Tom never did that. 
I'm real sorry to hear that. 
I'm not too sure about that. 
I'm not sure how to do that. 
I'm not satisfied with that. 
I'm not prepared to do that. 
I'm not letting Tom do that. 
I'll never get used to that. 
I'd rather not discuss that. 
I'd have to agree with that. 
I'd already thought of that. 
I wish you hadn't seen that. 
I was afraid you'd say that. 
I was afraid you'd ask that. 
I don't want Tom to do that. 
Tom lied to you about that. 
I'm unwilling to risk that. 
I'm still angry about that. 
I'm sorry, I can't do that. 
I'm not talking about that. 
I'm not so sure about that. 
I'm not interested in that. 
I'm not going to need that. 
I'm not allowed to do that. 
I'm going to tell Tom that. 
I'm delighted to hear that. 
I'll have to remember that. 
I was hoping you'd do that. 
I'm real upset about that. 
I'm not going to say that. 
I'm not going to eat that. 
I'm going to work on that. 
I'll try to remember that. 
I wouldn't recommend that. 
I told Tom not to do that. 
I need a receipt for that. 
I'm unwilling to do that. 
I'm not going to do that. 
I'm going to ignore that. 
I'd recommend doing that. 
I'd forgotten about that. 
I'm going to go do that. 
I'm fully aware of that. 
I'd be crazy to do that. 
I'd never ever do that. 
I wasn't aware of that. 
I was going to do that. 
I don't intend to do that. 
I don't want to tell Tom that. 
Tom won't go along with that. 
Maybe you shouldn't eat that. 
I can't believe Tom did that. 
Why did you have to do that? 
What're you doing with that? 
You didn't need to do that. 
You didn't have to do that. 
Why do you have to do that? 
We were ordered to do that. 
Tom hadn't considered that. 
We'll never agree to that. 
Tom wasn't expecting that. 
Tom never considered that. 
Tom hadn't expected that. 
I'll never agree to that. 
I hope you understand that. 
What was Tom's problem with that? 
I've got no problem with that. 
Who has a problem with that? 
Tom had a problem with that. 
Tom will never believe that. 
Did you really believe that? 
You're mistaken about that. 
You must never forget that. 
I'm not certain about that. 
I'll do anything but that. 
You never should've done that. 
We've already discussed that. 
I should've expected that. 
You've already explained that. 
Let's definitely do that. 
I anticipated that. 
Tom had no right to do that. 
You're not supposed to know that. 
I wish I hadn't said that. 
Why didn't I think of that? 
Do you think you can do that? 
How did Tom know about that? 
There isn't time to do that. 
What do you know about that? 
Why didn't you think of that? 
Do you know how to do that? 
Do you really believe that? 
I'm not certain Tom likes that. 
I'm not ready to do that. 
We asked you not to do that. 
We must concentrate on that. 
We're not allowed to do that. 
We're not ready to do that. 
Why didn't you just say that? 
You forgot to mention that. 
You're not allowed to do that. 
You've got to stop doing that. 
Did you tell Tom to do that? 
Why would anyone do that? 
I really should've known that. 
How are you not seeing that? 
Do you think you could do that? 
I never suggested that. 
Whatever happened to that? 
Who taught you how to do that? 
Why would you want to buy that? 
I never should've bought that. 
Can you give me some of that? 
You shouldn't have eaten that. 
Why aren't you eating that? 
Of course, Tom doesn't mean that. 
We've never talked about that. 
We'll have to talk about that. 
We don't need talk about that. 
You can't talk to me like that. 
Don't talk about Tom like that. 
Tom never spoke about that. 
Who's going to pay for that? 
You told me not to do that. 
Tom told us not to do that. 
Tom told me how to do that. 
Tom told me all about that. 
Why was Tom told to do that? 
Why didn't you tell us that? 
Why didn't you tell me that? 
Did Tom tell you to do that? 
Why didn't you tell Tom that? 
I'll be sure to tell Tom that. 
You know I can't tell you that. 
So why don't you tell Tom that? 
You've been told not to do that. 
You're the one who told me that. 
You shouldn't have told Tom that. 
I don't know why I said that. 
What would cause something like that? 
We're going to work on that. 
We're not getting into that. 
We're not going to do that. 
We didn't need Tom for that. 
We know it's not about that. 
We should get going on that. 
We weren't involved in that. 
We were going to try that. 
We already covered that. 
Can you identify that? 
Can we forget about that? 
Can I trust you to do that? 
Can I count on you for that? 
Can we trust Tom to do that? 
I'm still not sure about that. 
I'm not sure why I did that. 
I'm not worried about that. 
I didn't see Tom do that. 
Do you think I enjoyed that? 
You were smart not to eat that. 
Do you need some help with that? 
You said you wouldn't do that. 
You know I didn't mean that. 
You knew I wouldn't do that. 
You and I aren't like that. 
How did Tom feel about that? 
You need to stop saying that. 
You have to trust me on that. 
You don't get to decide that. 
You can't be certain of that. 
I regret that I did that. 
Do you want me to do that? 
Tom will appreciate that. 
Tom was happy about that. 
Why do I have to do that? 
He was too shy to do that. 
Do you want to bet on that? 
I was deeply moved by that. 
I wish you had told me that. 
Tom didn't seem to want that. 
I really should have known that. 
How do I report a theft? 
Tom was arrested for theft. 
I don't like any of them. 
I don't know either of them. 
He made a clean break with them. 
I felt awkward around them. 
I've already tested them. 
If you can't beat them, join them. 
I don't want either of them. 
Let's try to reason with them. 
I thought Tom was one of them. 
Why did you want to buy them? 
Don't you worry about them? 
Tom really didn't need them. 
I thought you didn't like them. 
I'm going to talk to them. 
I'm going to go join them. 
I never heard back from them. 
I wanted to be like them. 
What do you know about them? 
We're going to replace them. 
Can you identify them? 
Tom and Mary killed themselves. 
They quarreled among themselves. 
Was the baby crying then? 
We were in a hurry then. 
I was not studying then. 
Tom has changed a lot since then. 
I was still a student then. 
I was young and naive then. 
I wasn't on duty then. 
What do you think I'll do then? 
What are you suggesting then? 
I was in Canada then. 
I was so happy back then. 
I was eating dinner then. 
He stuck with his own theory. 
Tom doesn't have a theory. 
You said you had a theory. 
Tom studied music theory. 
Are you buying that theory? 
Let me tell you my theory. 
It'll be therapeutic. 
I'm seeing a therapist. 
The toilet is over there. 
I saw a strange woman there. 
Do you know how to get there? 
He advised me to go there. 
My parents let me go there. 
I wouldn't like to live there. 
I saw Jessie standing there. 
I thought I saw someone there. 
She advised him to go there. 
I don't want to go back there. 
How many apples are there? 
I don't even want you there. 
I don't want to go up there. 
Tom doesn't want to be there. 
Tom doesn't want to go there. 
Why would I want to go there? 
Why would Tom want to go there? 
I want to know what's out there. 
We were all so happy there. 
I know Tom's not happy there. 
There must be something in there. 
Did anyone see you there? 
Is anybody in there? 
Is there anybody there? 
Was anybody else there? 
Was anybody in there? 
What time is it over there? 
How many windows are there? 
How many of them are there? 
How many of us are there? 
How many players are there? 
Why don't you just meet me there? 
I didn't know you were there. 
I expect you to be there. 
I had to get out of there. 
I don't want you working there. 
I think that's Tom over there. 
I'm sure we'll find something there. 
I'll tell Tom to meet you there. 
You won't even know I'm there. 
I'm pretty sure I'll be there. 
I'm afraid you can't go there. 
I'll see you when I get there. 
I'm not allowed to go there. 
I'm going to meet Tom there. 
I'll probably see you there. 
You aren't allowed in there. 
I never knew it was there. 
What were you doing in there? 
What are they doing in there? 
Tom and Mary weren't there. 
Tom is the only one there. 
Are you going to be there? 
There's something going on there. 
Are you going to go there? 
What was going on in there? 
What were you doing up there? 
We're not allowed to go there. 
What are they doing out there? 
What are you doing out there? 
Tom advised me to go there. 
Is anybody out there? 
We just happened to be there. 
What's happening over there? 
What really happened out there? 
There's a pay phone over there. 
Why are you just sitting there? 
What sort of danger is there? 
There's something moving down there. 
I was the only man there. 
We ought to get over there. 
Nobody's allowed in there. 
Can you see that over there? 
I'm not going to be there. 
How many of us were there? 
How many colors are there? 
He almost never went there. 
Everyone but Tom was there. 
How many of them were there? 
My parents made me go there. 
What other options are there? 
He often eats breakfast there. 
What were you doing down there? 
What was it that you did there? 
What time did you arrive there? 
Thousands of people were there. 
Someone must have left it there. 
What's the best way to get there? 
I think there's someone out there. 
We can't accept all of these. 
Why don't you try one of these? 
We're not supposed to have these. 
Do you sell a lot of these? 
I wanted to give you these. 
Can we get copies of these? 
Do you want me to count these? 
Tom turned out to be a thief. 
He always says the same thing. 
He's good at this sort of thing. 
Why did he do such a thing? 
Everyone ate the same thing. 
Why would Tom do such a thing? 
Don't worry about a thing. 
Tom won't remember a thing. 
Tom didn't notice a thing. 
You won't remember a thing. 
Let's just forget the whole thing. 
Let's hope we did the right thing. 
I don't remember a thing. 
Tom did a terrible thing. 
Tom doesn't suspect a thing. 
I've been thinking the same thing. 
I have to do the same thing. 
I imagined the whole thing. 
I know you'll do the right thing. 
I might've done the same thing. 
I think I did the right thing. 
I think you did the right thing. 
Tom would've done the same thing. 
I wish I'd done the right thing. 
I was thinking the same thing. 
I don't do that kind of thing. 
I'm afraid of the same thing. 
You've hardly eaten a thing. 
I know I did the right thing. 
I know I did the wrong thing. 
Why did you say such a thing? 
Shut up and don't say a thing. 
Everyone thinks the same thing. 
Where did you find that strange thing? 
Do you believe in such things? 
Tom likes trying out new things. 
Tom did some terrible things. 
I can do a lot of things. 
I remember many things. 
We talked about lots of things. 
We can get a lot of things. 
Nobody cares what you think. 
Tom eats less than you might think. 
Tom doesn't know what to think. 
Tom didn't have time to think. 
Tom can handle it, I think. 
Tom can do better, I think. 
Tom wanted to stop and think. 
I'd like to know what you think. 
I'd like to hear what you think. 
I can't tell you what I think. 
I want to know what you think. 
It's important, don't you think? 
I didn't know what to think. 
I don't care what people think. 
I don't know what Tom will think. 
I think you know what I think. 
You've seen this before, I think. 
Tom's not as bad as you think. 
I'm asking you what you think. 
You're about my age, I think. 
That would be nice, don't you think? 
Tom is older than you think. 
That's what you told Tom, I think. 
I know what you are thinking. 
We can't act without thinking. 
I acted without thinking. 
I'm just sitting here thinking. 
Tom acted without thinking. 
What are you people thinking? 
Can you guess what I'm thinking? 
Can you tell what I'm thinking? 
I know what Tom is thinking. 
I want to know how Tom thinks. 
I want to hear what Tom thinks. 
I've learned to think like Tom thinks. 
I can tell you what Tom thinks. 
I was hungry and thirsty. 
We were all very thirsty. 
Tom told me he was thirsty. 
Tom was in his late thirties. 
Tom is in his late thirties. 
Tom is in his mid-thirties. 
It begins at six-thirty. 
He can't be under thirty. 
She can't be over thirty. 
Tom must be over thirty.

Have you eaten supper yet? 
Has your father arrived yet? 
Have you finished breakfast yet? 
I'd like to live in New York. 
How far is it to New York? 
You can drive a car, can't you? 
You lied to me, didn't you? 
You don't like chocolate, do you? 
You aren't a spy, are you? 
You have lovely eyes, don't you? 
I didn't mean to hurt you. 
I regret that I told you. 
I'm very glad to see you. 
I can't hide the fact from you. 
I partly agree with you. 
Tom can swim as fast as you. 
I'm sorry to trouble you. 
Can I put this up for you? 
May I leave this book with you? 
Does this book belong to you? 
Does this cap belong to you? 
I am willing to help you. 
I'm sorry to bother you. 
Can anyone believe you? 
It's my duty to help you. 
You aren't busy, are you? 
I owe my success to you. 
I have something to give you. 
I have a surprise for you. 
The police are after you. 
I'll act as a guide for you. 
I'll show my album to you. 
I do want to go with you. 
I am glad to be with you. 
I have confidence in you. 
He has a slight edge on you. 
He's always looking at you. 
He has a grudge against you. 
They must be waiting for you. 
They might be taller than you. 
You will keep your word, won't you? 
I don't know how to thank you. 
I'd be happy to help you. 
I'm only thinking of you. 
If you hurt her, I'll kill you. 
Get out of here! All of you! 
I have less money than you. 
I don't want to go with you. 
I don't feel like helping you. 
I don't want to talk to you. 
I promise you I'll help you. 
I think I'll always love you. 
I'd do anything for you. 
I'm deeply in love with you. 
I'm falling in love with you. 
I'm really in love with you. 
What can I do to help you? 
What does your mother call you? 
He can run as fast as you. 
You didn't see Tom, did you? 
Tom doubts that Mary loves you. 
I'm disappointed in you. 
Tom doesn't agree with you. 
We've been talking about you. 
Since I'm here, let me help you. 
Tom thinks beer is good for you. 
Tom has a surprise for you. 
Tom has been waiting for you. 
Tom has something to tell you. 
You got here late, didn't you? 
I thought I wouldn't find you. 
Welcome back, Tom. We've missed you. 
We're all very proud of you. 
I can't lend this book to you. 
I regret having told you. 
You can't make someone like you. 
I have something to show you. 
Do you take work home with you? 
I don't know much about you. 
I know a lot about you. 
I wanted to talk with you. 
I didn't do it for you. 
I enjoy eating with you. 
I've never stopped loving you. 
It's a pleasure to meet you. 
I'm trying to talk to you. 
I'm not going to hurt you. 
Don't worry. I'll protect you. 
Don't move unless I tell you. 
Just don't tell Tom I sent you. 
Tom will never forgive you. 
Tom thought quite highly of you. 
Tom really cares about you. 
Tom ordered this drink for you. 
Tom isn't afraid of you. 
Tom will be thrilled to see you. 
You've been busy, haven't you? 
You make good money, don't you? 
You know why I'm here, don't you? 
You know where Tom is, don't you? 
You know what I want, don't you? 
You don't know my dad, do you? 
You don't have a wife, do you? 
You don't believe me, do you? 
You brought them here, didn't you? 
You aren't jealous, are you? 
Why didn't Tom go with you? 
Why are people scared of you? 
I don't feel sorry for you. 
I don't want to marry you. 
I really want to see you. 
I should've listened to you. 
I wouldn't do that to you. 
I want to practice with you. 
I'll always be there for you. 
I'm not here to arrest you. 
I'm not supposed to tell you. 
I've got a question for you. 
I've got something to show you. 
We're not here to arrest you. 
We have medicine for you. 
You know we'd never hurt you. 
I'd like to go out with you. 
We can't afford to lose you. 
I can't believe Tom told you. 
I can't discuss that with you. 
I can't do it without you. 
We can't do this without you. 
I can't even look at you. 
I can't function without you. 
You can't let it get to you. 
I can't make it without you. 
I thought Tom was here with you. 
I wasn't talking to you. 
You enjoyed that, didn't you? 
You're in trouble, aren't you? 
We only want to help you. 
I didn't want to hurt you. 
I didn't want to wake you. 
I don't want to upset you. 
Tom wanted to talk to you. 
Do you want us to call you? 
I'd like to confide in you. 
I don't want to disturb you. 
Tom doesn't want to see you. 
Tom wanted to talk with you. 
Why would I want to sue you? 
You wanted this, didn't you? 
I'd like to start seeing you. 
Tom doesn't want to lose you. 
Tom wants a meeting with you. 
Tom wants to get to know you. 
You don't want to go, do you? 
Do you want this or don't you? 
I don't want to talk with you. 
I don't want to walk with you. 
I just don't want to lose you. 
We don't want to pressure you. 
I don't want to fight with you. 
I don't want to speak with you. 
You don't want me here, do you? 
I just want what's best for you. 
You want to leave here, don't you? 
I didn't want to tell you. 
I really want to kiss you. 
I didn't want to scare you. 
Tom, I want to talk to you. 
I don't want to trouble you. 
I still want to talk to you. 
I don't want to work for you. 
I want to stay here with you. 
Tom, I want to stay with you. 
I don't want to lie to you. 
I want to spend time with you. 
Why does Tom want to kill you? 
I want to be here with you. 
I'm very happy for you. 
I'm so happy to see you. 
We are happy to see you. 
I'm happy for all of you. 
I'm so happy to meet you. 
I'm just happy to see you. 
I'm sure happy to see you. 
You're happy here, aren't you? 
I often dream about you. 
I certainly don't blame you. 
I can't say that I blame you. 
I'm learning so much from you. 
Is something troubling you? 
I've got something to tell you. 
You've seen something, haven't you? 
Can I do something for you? 
Did something happen to you? 
Something's happened to you. 
Did Tom say something to you? 
I got something nice for you. 
I may have something for you. 
Does this mean something to you? 
You found something, didn't you? 
No one will ever find you. 
No one here will betray you. 
Did anyone else help you? 
Did anybody see you? 
Didn't anyone tell you? 
Was anybody with you? 
I don't know what to tell you. 
There's someone here to see you. 
I would like a word with you. 
I don't want to offend you. 
I wasn't looking at you. 
I didn't recognize you. 
I didn't understand you. 
I almost didn't see you. 
I didn't even see you. 
I didn't know about you. 
I just don't understand you. 
I really don't envy you. 
It doesn't belong to you. 
Maybe Tom didn't hear you. 
Tom really doesn't like you. 
Why doesn't that bother you? 
Won't anyone sit with you? 
You already know, don't you? 
You didn't forget, did you? 
You didn't touch it, did you? 
You do understand, don't you? 
You don't remember, do you? 
You got divorced, didn't you? 
You got fired, didn't you? 
You got married, didn't you? 
You recognize this, don't you? 
You recognize Tom, don't you? 
You remember her, don't you? 
You remember him, don't you? 
You remember me, don't you? 
You remember that, don't you? 
You remember them, don't you? 
You remember Tom, don't you? 
You saw something, didn't you? 
You still don't trust me, do you? 
You understand that, don't you? 
You understand this, don't you? 
You were bluffing, weren't you? 
You were hungry, weren't you? 
You were jealous, weren't you? 
You were lying, weren't you? 
You were sleeping, weren't you? 
You were watching, weren't you? 
Don't make me come after you. 
Don't say I didn't warn you. 
Don't stop until I tell you. 
I didn't give it to you. 
I didn't hang up on you. 
I didn't mean to hit you. 
I didn't mean to scare you. 
I didn't mean to wake you. 
I didn't mean to spook you. 
I didn't want to bug you. 
I always have time for you. 
I asked around about you. 
I believe I can help you. 
I brought a present for you. 
I came by to check on you. 
I came here to rescue you. 
I can carry that for you. 
I can get Tom to help you. 
I can see that bothers you. 
I can see that disturbs you. 
I can tell Tom still likes you. 
I can't believe I kissed you. 
I can't go back without you. 
I can't explain it to you. 
I can't wait to be with you. 
I care a great deal for you. 
I care about all of you. 
I could fall in love with you. 
I could have bought that for you. 
I could never be like you. 
I could order that for you. 
I couldn't do that to you. 
I don't know what I owe you. 
I don't take orders from you. 
I don't have to talk to you. 
I don't know how to reach you. 
I don't know what to call you. 
I don't need to talk to you. 
I don't think I can help you. 
I don't think this is for you. 
I don't want to be with you. 
I enjoy talking with you. 
I guess that's why I love you. 
I guess you know I've missed you. 
I had my doubts about you. 
I had to look after you. 
I hadn't planned to tell you. 
That's what I love about you. 
That's what I like about you. 
I hardly even know you. 
I hardly recognized you. 
I've fallen in love with you. 
What does it look like to you? 
I have a message for you. 
I have a mission for you. 
I have a package for you. 
I have a present for you. 
I have a question for you. 
I have a small gift for you. 
I've been concerned about you. 
I've been dying to meet you. 
I've been here longer than you. 
I've been here waiting for you. 
I've been hoping to meet you. 
I've been ordered to kill you. 
I've been sent to escort you. 
I've been sent to relieve you. 
I've been trying to reach you. 
I've been worried about you. 
I've come to depend on you. 
I have complete faith in you. 
I've done OK without you. 
I've enjoyed working with you. 
I haven't forgotten you. 
I've got a project for you. 
I've got a surprise for you. 
I've got some good news for you. 
I've heard good things about you. 
I have no wish to harm you. 
I have one question for you. 
I have other plans for you. 
I have some questions for you. 
I have three options for you. 
I have three questions for you. 
I've told Tom all about you. 
I heard what Tom said to you. 
I hope I'm not boring you. 
I don't believe that. Do you? 
I don't want to believe you. 
I don't want to fire you. 
I hope I didn't wake you. 
I hope we didn't wake you. 
I know Tom doesn't like you. 
I promise I won't hurt you. 
I won't be going with you. 
I'm not listening to you. 
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you. 
I just can't live without you. 
I just need to talk to you. 
I just wanted to thank you. 
I just wanted to warn you. 
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you. 
I know I've been hard on you. 
I know Tom better than you. 
I know what they're paying you. 
I know what Tom meant to you. 
I know you have it with you. 
I love spending time with you. 
I loved working here with you. 
I miss hanging out with you. 
I need a moment with you. 
I needed to talk to you. 
I never even saw you. 
I never meant to hurt you. 
I never stopped loving you. 
I only wish to help you. 
I remember both of you. 
Don't let me influence you. 
I kept the seat warm for you. 
I still need to talk to you. 
I wanted to impress you. 
Sorry, I didn't hear you. 
Tom and Mary don't like you. 
You recognize her, don't you? 
You recognize him, don't you? 
You understand French, don't you? 
You're done working, aren't you? 
You're not staying here, are you? 
You're still single, aren't you? 
You're Tom's parents, aren't you? 
I said I believe in you. 
I saw Tom try to kiss you. 
I see a future with you. 
I see no need to tell you. 
I sense that I can trust you. 
I should've been there for you. 
I should've been there with you. 
I shouldn't have doubted you. 
I shouldn't have lied to you. 
I think I'm in love with you. 
I think this coat should fit you. 
I think Tom really likes you. 
I think Tom wants to see you. 
I would never lie to you. 
Tom speaks French as well as you. 
I'm not gonna lie to you. 
I enjoy being with you. 
You know my dog's name, don't you? 
You know what we need, don't you? 
You know what this is, don't you? 
You know how it works, don't you? 
Tom won't leave his dog with you. 
Tom won't know where to find you. 
I'll make sure Tom writes to you. 
You're not meeting Tom, are you? 
You're good at this, aren't you? 
You wouldn't do that, would you? 
I'll sharpen your knife for you. 
I thought I'd leave that to you. 
You've got to take me with you. 
You're very strong, aren't you? 
You're the new guy, aren't you? 
You wouldn't hit me, would you? 
You worked for Tom, didn't you? 
You know what to do, don't you? 
Tom would've tried to stop you. 
Someone's on the phone for you. 
You're not listening, are you? 
You're not asking me, are you? 
You know about Tom, don't you? 
Tom won't leave Mary with you. 
I'm sure Tom will forgive you. 
I'm just surprised to see you. 
I'll get Tom's number for you. 
I'll get Tom to stay with you. 
I'll do your homework for you. 
I'll call you when I need you. 
I'll always have time for you. 
You're a bad boy, aren't you? 
Why would I want to help you? 
We wouldn't like to lose you. 
Tom wouldn't go out with you. 
I'm still not talking to you. 
I'm just looking out for you. 
I'm here to take care of you. 
I'm afraid we can't help you. 
I'll try to be more like you. 
I'll tell you when I see you. 
I'll tell Tom to contact you. 
I'll have to get back to you. 
I'll be here waiting for you. 
I'll always take care of you. 
I'd stand back if I were you. 
I wouldn't leave without you. 
I would've done that for you. 
You're not serious, are you? 
You're a member, aren't you? 
You were angry, weren't you? 
I'm supposed to protect you. 
I'm sorry, I can't hear you. 
I'm not trying to cheat you. 
I'm not sure I can help you. 
I'm not leaving without you. 
I'm not allowed to tell you. 
I'm better looking than you. 
I'll look after Tom for you. 
I'll hang onto that for you. 
I'll go and find it for you. 
I'll demonstrate it for you. 
I'll call you if I need you. 
I'll be very frank with you. 
I told you I can't help you. 
We won't do it without you. 
Tom won't be afraid of you. 
I'm thinking of firing you. 
I'm sorry I frightened you. 
I'm really glad to see you. 
I'm not sure I believe you. 
I'm not going to shoot you. 
I'm not going to leave you. 
I'm not going to judge you. 
I'm not going to fight you. 
I'm not going to blame you. 
I'm not doing this for you. 
I'm leaving that up to you. 
I'm just worried about you. 
I'm better off without you. 
I'm being paid to help you. 
I'll open the door for you. 
I'll always care about you. 
I'll always believe in you. 
I won't be coming with you. 
I wish I could talk to you. 
I wish I could go with you. 
I wish I could believe you. 
I was just looking for you. 
I was holding this for you. 
I used to be rich like you. 
I used to be poor like you. 
I told you I'd protect you. 
I told Tom not to tell you. 
I'm trying to protect you. 
I'm not worried about you. 
I'm not going without you. 
I'm not going to tell you. 
I'm not going to show you. 
I'm not going to kiss you. 
I'm no different than you. 
I'm going to cook for you. 
I'm done listening to you. 
I'm delighted to meet you. 
I'm being honest with you. 
I'll never understand you. 
I'd take it if I were you. 
I'd be willing to pay you. 
I was trying to reach you. 
I was told to contact you. 
I was as surprised as you. 
I used to be fat like you. 
We're very happy for you. 
I'm sorry to disturb you. 
I'm sorry I bothered you. 
I'm going to forgive you. 
I'm getting tired of you. 
I'm delighted to see you. 
I'm afraid of losing you. 
I'll be able to show you. 
I'll be able to help you. 
I'd never do that to you. 
I wasn't laughing at you. 
I'm sorry if I hurt you. 
I'm sorry I lied to you. 
I'm sorry I doubted you. 
I'm going to report you. 
I'm glad I ran into you. 
I'm glad I invited you. 
I was never mad at you. 
I wasn't ignoring you. 
I wasn't avoiding you. 
You're not feeling well, are you? 
You're not ready yet, are you? 
You're all hungry, aren't you? 
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you. 
You're busy here, aren't you? 
You're all busy, aren't you? 
You were happy, weren't you? 
Why did they do this to you? 
Tom and I will wait for you. 
Has Tom ever threatened you? 
You were busy, weren't you? 
You know we care about you. 
Tom can carry that for you. 
We were worried about you. 
Tom was worried about you. 
Nobody's as fast as you. 
Tom isn't ignoring you. 
You're from Boston, aren't you? 
We're not leaving without you. 
You're very rich, aren't you? 
It's a privilege to meet you. 
You're busy now, aren't you? 
Nothing will happen to you. 
I'm sorry I can't help you. 
Tom was crazy about you. 
Tom should've listened to you. 
We'll take real good care of you. 
I would go if I were you. 
You've never liked me, have you? 
I don't want to live with you. 
I have some bad news for you. 
I think they really like you. 
Tom was anxious to meet you. 
Excuse me, but who are you? 
Give us a minute, will you? 
Give us a minute, would you? 
It's totally up to you. 
We've always protected you. 
I have to agree with you. 
I hear that Tom hired you. 
We have no quarrel with you. 
We never meant to harm you. 
We were all so proud of you. 
You complain a lot, don't you? 
You have a brother, don't you? 
You'd hire me, wouldn't you? 
You're not scared of snakes, are you? 
You're scared of Tom, aren't you? 
You're scared to death, aren't you? 
It's hard to understand you. 
Tom left everything to you. 
Tom is going to pay you. 
Tom is depending on you. 
I'm not arguing with you. 
I wasn't sure it was you. 
Does Tom seem insane to you? 
Let's see if we can help you. 
What if somebody sees you? 
Tell Tom what Mary told you. 
What does that suggest to you? 
How did this happen to you? 
I know what happened to you. 
When did that happen to you? 
You don't like Tom much, do you? 
We've got some questions for you. 
I've got some questions for you. 
You didn't buy that, did you? 
Where's the red tie I bought you? 
We're not buying it from you. 
You'll give it a shot, won't you? 
Give me a minute, will you? 
Call the number I gave you. 
You're not giving up, are you? 
Give me a minute, would you? 
What drugs are they giving you? 
Is that the belt I gave you? 
It's my job to convince you. 
Tom was trying to help you. 
Have I ever lied to you? 
Do I look desperate to you? 
You haven't seen one, have you? 
You really think so, don't you? 
You do get around, don't you? 
You miss Tom a lot, don't you? 
You're pretty rich, aren't you? 
It must be so hard for you. 
Tom never talked about you. 
People like to talk to you. 
It was good talking to you. 
Hey, I want to talk to you. 
Hey Tom, can I talk to you? 
Why don't we talk about you? 
Tom said not to talk to you. 
It was great talking to you. 
I'm finished talking to you. 
Tom, I've got to talk to you. 
You talked to Tom, didn't you? 
It's been nice talking to you. 
Did Tom try to speak to you? 
Why is Tom staying with you? 
I can't afford to pay you. 
You should've brought lunch with you. 
I was going to tell you. 
Remember what I told you. 
Why would I ever tell you? 
Tom told us all about you. 
Tom told me all about you. 
Tom has told me about you. 
That is all I can tell you. 
Only do what Tom tells you. 
Tom told me not to help you. 
I was told not to trust you. 
I told you I could find you. 
Forget what I just told you. 
You didn't tell Tom, did you? 
That's why I didn't tell you. 
Tell me what's bothering you. 
We have something to tell you. 
You haven't told Tom, have you? 
There's nothing I can tell you. 
I don't think I should tell you. 
Please don't tell Tom I told you. 
You think I'm stupid, don't you? 
Everyone is proud of you. 
That's optimistic of you. 
Is this good enough for you? 
Can I get something for you? 
We're going to protect you. 
We're not going to hurt you. 
We're not going to harm you. 
We're trying to rescue you. 
We just wanted to help you. 
We can manage without you. 
Is this big enough for you? 
Did anyone follow you? 
Can I be honest with you? 
Can we have a word with you? 
Can you do it or can't you? 
I'll wait out in front for you. 
I'm sorry I startled you. 
You want me to go, don't you? 
You can't open it, can you? 
You know who did it, don't you? 
You know why we're here, don't you? 
You think I'm bluffing, don't you? 
You think Tom's handsome, don't you? 
You think you're funny, don't you? 
You weren't kidding, were you? 
You didn't do it, did you? 
Do you think I'm scared of you? 
You need someone to help you. 
You didn't know Tom, did you? 
You know I won't lie to you. 
You didn't say yes, did you? 
You didn't find it, did you? 
You're unhappy, aren't you? 
Did Tom seem OK to you? 
You think I did it, don't you? 
You know who I am, don't you? 
You know I don't believe you. 
You should've let me help you. 
You don't have to go, do you? 
You're talkative, aren't you? 
You're lying now, aren't you? 
You're impatient, aren't you? 
You're efficient, aren't you? 
You're ambitious, aren't you? 
You got stood up, didn't you? 
You don't have a gun, do you? 
You don't believe it, do you? 
You do like music, don't you? 
You do believe me, don't you? 
I will accompany you. 
I was worried about you. 
I am disgusted with you. 
Tom is not as old as you. 
Do you have a pen on you? 
Do whatever he tells you. 
I can swim as well as you. 
I want to travel with you. 
Why is Tom laughing at you? 
Can I have a word with you? 
How much is it worth to you? 
I know this is hard for you. 
Didn't that seem odd to you? 
Tom seemed happy to see you. 
She is more famous than you. 
When is a good time for you? 
Is the job too much for you? 
What is the matter with you? 
Why didn't Tom come with you? 
I should've known it was you. 
I baked these cookies for you. 
You live here alone, don't you? 
You've been drinking, haven't you? 
You've put on weight, haven't you? 
I did smoke when I was young. 
It was her fate to die young. 
They married when they were young. 
We got married very young. 
I don't want to look younger. 
I bought the same shirt as yours. 
Whatever I have is yours. 
Whose house is across from yours? 
I brought mine. Did you bring yours? 
It's not my problem. It's yours. 
How many of these are yours? 
Which of these rackets is yours? 
Don't be ashamed of yourself. 
Did you do it by yourself? 
Don't be so hard on yourself. 
You should take care of yourself. 
You can't do it by yourself. 
You can't even help yourself. 
Are you enjoying yourself? 
Why don't you ask Tom yourself? 
Why don't you do it yourself? 
Why don't you do that yourself? 
Why don't you see for yourself? 
Please identify yourself. 
Why didn't you save yourself? 
Don't be too hard on yourself. 
You'll have to ask Tom yourself. 
You've often said so yourself. 
You could've gone by yourself. 
You suggested it yourself. 
You have to do it yourself. 
You'll have to do it yourself. 
Make sure you don't hurt yourself. 
You'd better see for yourself. 
Now tell me about yourself. 
Tell us more about yourself. 
You'll have to tell Tom yourself. 
You're going to hurt yourself. 
Don't overexert yourself. 
Did you study by yourself? 
Did you make it by yourself? 
You're embarrassing yourself. 
You seem to have hurt yourself. 
Please identify yourselves. 
Divide this among yourselves. 
You're embarrassing yourselves. 
Count from 10 down to zero. 
I have a broken zipper. 
We saw monkeys at the zoo. 
She went with him to the zoo. 
I've never been to a zoo.
