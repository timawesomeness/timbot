#timbot - a simple SSL IRC bot written in Python3

#####A lot of stuff is meant specifically for Snoonet (and gonzobot-using channels specifically), so should be adapted/removed if using on a different IRC network.

##Configuration:

Edit options.py and add information as directed.

##Usage:

#####You must have python3 installed!
Run `python3 timbot.py` and the bot will autoconnect and join the channels set in options.py automatically.
